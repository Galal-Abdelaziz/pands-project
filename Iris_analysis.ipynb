    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Iris dataset__ is one of the most well-known and commonly used datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Iris dataset consists of __150 samples__ of iris flowers from three different species: [Setosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa), [Versicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor), and [Virginica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each sample includes __four features__:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * __Sepal length__: The length of the iris flower’s sepals (the green leaf-like structures that encase the flower bud).\n",
    "    * __Sepal width__: The width of the iris flower’s sepals.\n",
    "    * __Petal length__: The length of the iris flower’s petals (the colored structures of the flower).\n",
    "    * __Petal width__: The width of the iris flower’s petals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Species in the Iris Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable denotes the species of the iris flower, featuring three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Iris Setosa__: Identified by its relatively small size and distinctive sepal and petal dimensions.\n",
    "* __Iris Versicolor__: Exhibiting moderate size, with characteristics intermediate between Setosa and Virginica.\n",
    "* __Iris Virginica__: Generally larger, with notable differences in sepal and petal dimensions compared to the other species.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Historical Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The dataset was introduced by the British biologist and statistician [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in 1936 as an example of [discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis).\n",
    "    * The Iris dataset laid the foundation for statistical analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "    * Ronald Fisher’s work on the dataset paved the way for the development of many classification algorithms still utilized today.\n",
    "    * It remains a pivotal benchmark for assessing new machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Role in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The dataset's popularity stems from its __simplicity__ and the __clear separation__ of the different species based on the provided features.\n",
    "    * The Iris dataset serves as a standard benchmark for testing [classification algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification#Algorithms).\n",
    "    * Researchers and data scientists use the features of the iris flowers to classify each sample into one of the three species.\n",
    "    * Researchers employ it to compare algorithmic performance and assess accuracy, precision, and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Iris dataset contains two types of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numeric Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Sepal length.\n",
    "    * Sepal width.\n",
    "    * Petal length.\n",
    "    * Petal width.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categorical Variable:\n",
    "    * The only categorical variable in the dataset is the variety/species of iris flowers. It includes three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Setosa.\n",
    "        * Versicolor.\n",
    "        * Virginica.\n",

    "    * __Setosa__ is easily distinguishable from Versicolor and Virginica based on petal dimensions (length and width), having significantly shorter and narrower  petals.\n",
